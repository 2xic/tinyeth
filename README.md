# tinyeth

Something like [https://github.com/2xic/Bitcoin-lib-small](https://github.com/2xic/Bitcoin-lib-small), but for Ethereum, tinyeth!

_Just something so I get a better understanding of the core parts of the protocol, don't use this in production_

### Plan

- [~] Implement encoding and decoding of RLP

  Currently added:

        - Basic support added currently

- [~] Signing of transactions

  Currently added:

        - Support for creating a key pair added, signing, and verification
        - Support for creating a raw transactions

- [ ] Implementation of parts of the EVM
