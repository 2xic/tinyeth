# tinyeth

Something like [https://github.com/2xic/Bitcoin-lib-small](https://github.com/2xic/Bitcoin-lib-small), but for Ethereum, tinyeth!

_Just something so I get a better understanding of the core parts of the protocol, don't use this in production_

### Plan

- [ ] (WIP) Implement encoding and decoding of RLP

  Currently added:
    - Support for primitive types, and partial bigint support

- [ ] (WIP) Construction of transactions

  Currently added:
    - Support for creating a key pair added, signing, and verification
    - Support for creating a raw transactions
    - (wip) signing of transactions

- [ ] Implementation parts of the EVM (i.e should be able to run a simple contract based on the bytecode)

- [ ] Data structures like block, transactions, accounts, etc

- [Â ] Maybe even some basic network support
