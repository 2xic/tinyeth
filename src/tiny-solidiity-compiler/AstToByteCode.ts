/*
Just some thoughts, implementation over the next few days
- Need to construct a jump table
    - We start with a simple empty contract
    - Then add one function
- I think we should try to match the solc compiler output, at least use it for reference.

- I think we can create small macros of evm code, and map that to functions.
