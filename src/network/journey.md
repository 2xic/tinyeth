# Trying to auth tinyeth and geth

So make it easier for me to know the state of things I guess I should write a notebook. Been working on the networking stuff on and off for a few weeks, so we are starting on day x, and tomorrow will be day x + 1 :).

### Day x
I have written a basic node server that listens on port 3000, and able to get geth to communicate with the node using the addNode command in the geht console.

Challenge now is that i'm not able to decrypt the message. Looks the like logic for doing the key exchange is not the same...

Will investigate this further tomorrow.
