https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/caps/eth.md is the protocol we need to implement to be able to fetch a block off the network.

some notes
- "Once a connection is established, a Status message must be sent. Following the reception of the peer's Status message, the Ethereum session is active and any other message may be sent."
